Revision history for Perl extension Math::SymbolicX::ParserExtensionFactory.

3.02  Wed Mar  4 18:11 2009
  - Fix regression introduced in 3.01 wrt. parsing *(...)
  - Require Math::Symbolic 0.603

3.01  Thu Feb  5 21:51 2009
  - Support for object-private parser extensions.

2.01  Sun Jan 27 14:36 2007
* This is a critical bug fix release for 2.00 *
  - Fix bug in the extension regex that would trigger only if there are
    extension names which are substrings of another extension.
    The other extension would have to be added after the short one.
    In those cases, the longer extension would never match.

2.00  Fri Jan 19 16:47 2007
* This release contains incompatible changes *
  - The extend-only-if-not-done-before logic now works even if the
    parser object of Math::Symbolic is replaced.
  - The previously very broken logic that would parse the argument
    string for the custom functions was replaced by Text::Balanced's
    extract_bracketed() which should reliably parse nested parenthesis.
    This means that you cannot escape parenthesis in an argument string
    any more!
  - Slightly improved tests.
  - If the parser is a Yapp parser instead of a RecDescent parser, this
    module now works as well! (Yapp parsers were introduced to
    Math::Symbolic somewhere around version 0.500. They are outrageously
    fast compared to the RecDescent parser.)
  - Now requiring Math::Symbolic 0.506 or better.

1.00  Wed Oct 12 21:04 2005
  - Distribution upgrade. Now using Module::Build
