Math::SymbolicX::ParserExtensionFactory
=======================================

This module provides a simple way to extend the Math::Symbolic parser with
arbitrary functions that return any valid Math::Symbolic tree.
The return value of the function call is
inserted into the complete parse tree at the point at which the function
call is parsed. Familiarity with the Math::Symbolic module will be
assumed throughout the documentation.
