Revision history for Perl extension Math::Symbolic::Custom::LaTeXDumper

0.208 Tue May 14 2013
  - Move POD tests from t/ to xt/

0.207 Fri Jun 24 2011
  - If generating TeX for something like
    x * -1
    we need to add parenthesis to the constant:
    x * (-1)
    While mathematically, the prefered way to print this
    example would be -x, the expression itself is kept the same
    by design. The same rule applies to unary minus operators
    and negative constants within sums, differences, and products.
