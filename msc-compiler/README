Math::Symbolic::Custom::CCompiler version 1.01
==============================================

This module extends the functionality of Math::Symbolic by offering
facilities to compile symbolic math trees (formulas) to C code. It
also uses Inline::C to compile and link the generated C code at
run-time, thus allowing the user to do symbolic calculations in Perl
with Math::Symbolic and then use the results in a fast numeric
environment.

This software is still experimental. The author appreciates feedback
of any kind.
