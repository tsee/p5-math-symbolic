Math::Symbolic::Custom::Pattern version 1.11
============================================

This module is an extension to the Math::Symbolic module. A basic
familiarity with that module is required.

The Math::Symbolic::Custom::Pattern module implements pattern matching routines
on Math::Symbolic trees. The patterns itself are constructed from
Math::Symbolic trees with just a few variables which have a special meaning.

Example pattern "VAR_foo + CONST*VAR_foo + VAR_bar + TREE"
matches "a + 4*a + b + sin(a*b+c-d)", but not "a + 4*c + b + sin(a*b+c-d)"
since the beginning "a +" sets VAR_foo to be "a" and "4*c" contradicts that.
Refer to the documentation for details.
