Math::SymbolicX::Statistics::Distributions version 1.02
=======================================================

This module offers easy access to formulas for a few often-used
distributions. For that, it uses the Math::Symbolic module which gives the
user an opportunity to manufacture distributions to his liking.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Math::Symbolic (version 0.128 and up)
  Test::LectroTest (tested with 0.3200, 0.3300 suggested!)
  Math::SymnbolicX::ParserExtensionFactory (version 0.01 and up)

NOTES

Test::LectroTest prior to 0.3300 contained a bug that caused the call
of the Makefile.PL script to fail due to its dependency check.

The call to Makefile.PL, however, results in a Makefile being correctly
written nonetheless. Just ignore the warning from Test::LectroTest!
