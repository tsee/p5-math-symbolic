This file contains the TODO milestones for Math::Symbolic.
+ => Met
- => Not met

Sooner-than-later:
	- Better testsuite as in: bring in some order and better coverage.
	- Clean up documentation.
	
	- Update TODO and clean it.
	- Make sure TODO and sourceforge task/issue/whatever trackers are in
	  sync.
	
	- Write a coherent, easy-to-understand, central section on variable
	  signatures and their purpose.
	
	- Should the operators/functions really be listed in the MS::Operator
	  man page or should they be listed in a more central place like
	  the main man page? Or both? (Duplicate docs are bad!)
	- Whatever's done about that last point, make sure the docs refer to
	  the correct portion about the operator list.

Random and unordered thoughts and ideas:
	- Differentials
	- Vector operations
	- Vector analysis
	- Equations
	- Symbolic calculator
	- Some idea of types/contexts?
	- n-ary operators
	- Equation solver
	- Canonical form
	- Improved term simplification! MUCH IMPROVED!
	- Integration (*laugh*)
	- Matrices

Version 0.120: (erm, we're past 0.120, sadly.)
	- Major change to MS::Operator guts:
	  - Separate ordinary operands such as the ones found with
	    arithmetic operators and the special operands such as the
	    deriving variable with derivatives.
	    Ordinary operands are to stay in the {operands} hash entry.
	    Special operands are to be put into a new {special} hash entry.
	    {special} is an array ref containing the special operands.
	    These are hashes themselves. They contain certain keys:
	    - type: The type of operand. May be "variable", "tree", "constant",
	      etc. ("identifier" even).
	    - value: The "payload".
	  - All code must be adapted to be aware of this change.
	  - This fixes the trouble one may have when "implementing" a
	    variable used for deriving, etc.
	  - Makes summation possible as a new operator. The function would
	    be the only ordinary operand. Lower, upper, and index variable
	    would all be special.
	- Documentation for the changes.
	- Tests for the changes.
