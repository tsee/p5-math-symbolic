Math::SymbolicX::BigNum version 0.02
====================================

This module adds big number support to Math::Symbolic. It does so by
extending the parser of the Math::Symbolic module (that is,
the one stored in $Math::Symbolic::Parser) with certain special functions
that create arbitrary precision constants. (Math::Symbolic::Variable objects
have been able to contain arbitrary precision objects since the very
beginning.)
