Math-SymbolicX-Inline
=====================

This module is an extension to the Math::Symbolic module. A basic
familiarity with that module is required.

Math::SymbolicX::Inline allows easy creation of Perl functions from
symbolic expressions in the context of Math::Symbolic. That means
you can define arbitrary Math::Symbolic trees (including derivatives)
and let this module compile them to package subroutines. 

There are relatively few syntax elements that aren't standard in
Math::Symbolic expressions, but those that exist are easier to
explain using examples. Thus, please refer to the discussion of
a simple example below which can be found in the manual page
of the module.

Simple, contrived example:
use Math::SymbolicX::Inline <<'HERE';
myfunction = partial_derivative( sin(x) * sin(x), x )
x (:=) arg0
HERE
print myfunction(3);
# prints the derivative of sin(x)**2 evaluated at x=3


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

On platforms that don't support the "./" notation, that would be:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

If you wish, you may use the old MakeMaker style instead:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Math::Symbolic (version 0.129 an higher)
